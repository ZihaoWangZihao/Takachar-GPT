The experiment aimed to compare the behavior of the reactor with the Indian MiniTorr v2, specifically in conveying coconut shells and rice husks at a 45-degree angle. The rectangular cross-sectional area of the California reactor was used to replicate previous tests.\n\n2. The primary blower position was adjusted to B4 and B6, while the secondary blower position remained the same at T3 and T5.\n\n3. Only rice husks were tested, as coconut shells did not convey well and may have been affected by deformed auger blades.\n\n4. The cyclic peaks observed during the experiment indicated different auger speeds at 6 RPM and 8 RPM. Visual observation is needed to confirm if each cycle corresponds to one full auger revolution.\n\n5. Smoke was observed escaping through the hopper and cracks in the system, likely due to the proximity of the combustion chamber to the hopper. Bridging occurred, indicated by excess white smoke and a change in color.\n\n6. The initial igniting process for rice hulls was challenging, requiring a hot fire initially and then adding the rice hulls. The blowers were set at 4000 primary and 5000 secondary.\n\n7. Ash, hot embers, and flames were observed coming from the cracks in the hopper, particularly where the hopper and combustion chamber meet facing the sky.\n\n8. Lowering the blowers to 3000/4000 resulted in flames coming out of the system cracks, but raising them back to 4000/5000 extinguished the flames.\n\n9. The flame became strong once steady state was reached, and the char appeared homogenized at the end of the run.\n\n10. A fire occurred in the system, causing the wires of Blower D to catch fire and the entire system to shut down. The damaged blower was unplugged, and the remaining blowers and auger were controlled by the PLC.\n\n11. The output feedrate was not measured during the hot test, but during post-test conveyance, it was approximately 2.2 kg/h at 6 RPM and 5.7 kg/h at 8 RPM, resulting in yields of 13% and 34%, respectively.\n\n12. The next step is to replace Blower D and continue running hot tests with the remaining three blowers in place.\n\nBased on this information, further analysis and experiments can be conducted to address the challenges observed, such as improving the conveying of coconut shells, addressing smoke and bridging issues, and ensuring the system's safety and stability.", 'The primary blower speed for this hot test is not mentioned in the provided information.', 'Example Answer: The motor RPM for Hot Test #64 started at 6, then increased to 10. When the motor started struggling, the RPM was lowered back to 6. The input feedrate for biomass was around 29 kg/h. Initially, there was smoke leaking from the hopper and cracks, which was unusual for a primary blower position so high up the reactor. It was later discovered that the damper of the chimney was on, and after removing it, the smoke disappeared. Ash out of the chimney was severe but came in episodes. The motor repeatedly got stuck, and it was observed that the motor driver wires got hot. The PLC also went haywire at one point, causing all blowers to go high and the motor to stop working. The motor was periodically stuck even after regaining control.

There was a lot of buildup in the reactor body from the rice hulls, but no jamming occurred. Smoke was observed towards the end of the experiment. The motor kept spinning while the auger was stopped for about 5 seconds. The auger initially tripped using woodchips. Some ash was coming out of the chimney. After the rice hulls went down, there was no significant smoke. The rice hulls built up very high in the reactor, and smoke was coming out of cracks. The mixed char in the first barrel was around 16 kg, and in the second barrel, it was around 12 kg.\n\nNext steps: The next steps include using fewer woodchips at a time or pushing woodchips through the combustion chamber instead of the reactor. It is also important to investigate the possible causes of jamming while rice hulls are being fed into the reactor.', 'The primary blower speed for this hot test is 4000.', 'The primary blower speed for the hot test #85 was 2000.', 'Based on the information provided, it seems that the main issue in this hot test was the jamming of the auger. The auger flights, particularly on the left side, were packed tightly and caused the auger to stop running multiple times during the test. This resulted in a failure of the experiment, as the auger was unable to run continuously.\n\nAdditionally, yellow smoke was observed emitting from cracks in the reactor, indicating incomplete combustion. The reactor fire also had difficulty being maintained at certain points during the test. \n\nPractically no biochar was collected at the end of the test, with only ash being collected. This suggests that the biomass was not effectively converted into biochar.\n\nThe auger itself was found to be significantly warped, with a large gap between the new auger and the welded piece on the top auger. This warping may have contributed to the jamming issues experienced during the test.\n\nBased on these observations, the next steps would involve fixing the gap between the auger flights to prevent jamming. It may also be beneficial to test a different biomass to assess the impact of the auger gap on the overall process. Additionally, further investigation into the causes of auger warping should be conducted, as it appears to occur more quickly than anticipated.\n\nThe provided picture observations and video of the jam could be helpful in analyzing the issues and identifying potential solutions.', 'Primary blower speed: 2500\nSecondary blower speed: 4000\nAuger speed: 6\nReactor temperature: 30°C\nReactor exit: Black bag\nChimney: Large\nPrimary air: B10/B12\n\nNotable observations:\n- Auger jammed multiple times\n- Noises coming from reactor after reversing the motor to stop jamming\n- Woodchips started pulling up like rice hulls, causing smoke from the chimney\n\nNext steps:\n- Investigate making smaller woodchips to prevent jamming\n- Explore using different biomasses and restocks, avoiding large woodchips\n- Lower the reactor angle to prevent piling of woodchips and rice hulls', 'The primary blower speed for this hot test is not mentioned in the provided information.', 'Based on the provided information, here is an example answer:\n\nThe primary blower speed for Hot Test #89 was not explicitly mentioned in the experiment description. Therefore, the answer would be N/A (not applicable).\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on the information provided and may not reflect the actual experimental conditions.', 'The primary blower speed for the experiment is not mentioned in the provided information.', "Based on the provided information, it seems that the experiment is focused on biomass combustion (pyrolysis) in the presence of oxygen to produce biochar. The experiment involves a small-sized reactor with a hopper for biomass input, an auger for biomass transportation, and thermocouples to measure temperature at different locations. Primary blowers provide air (oxygen) to the reactor zone, while secondary blowers remove volatiles through a chimney.\n\nThe objective of the experiment described is to achieve uniform charring and prevent auger tripping. The hypothesis being tested is that a lower rpm (duty cycle) of the auger will increase residence times and lead to more even charring. The experiment also mentions a constraint related to the smoke coming out of the hopper, which is not being addressed due to time constraints.\n\nThe initial parameters for the experiment include an auger speed of 6 rpm with a 50% duty cycle, primary air at 3000 rpm, secondary air at 4000 rpm, and an angle of inclination of 30 degrees. The positions of the primary and secondary air blowers are also specified.\n\nThe high-level summary of the experiment indicates that char did not accumulate in the chimney to the same extent as previous tests, preventing auger tripping. Evenly charred output was achieved, but there was consistent smoke from the hopper due to the char falling back due to the reactor's angle of inclination. Chimney emissions were mostly clean, but there was consistent ember emission, possibly due to a higher pile of char under the chimney. The experiment also mentions negative pressure in the chimney as desired.\n\nThe take-away from the experiment is that a lower duty cycle of the auger solves the issues of uneven charring and char accumulation in the chimney, as it reduces the rate at which biomass is drawn into the system.\n\nThe experiment suggests several pathways of investigation for further testing. These include reducing the angle of inclination to 15 degrees to address chimney build-up, auger jamming, and hopper smoke. Another pathway is to investigate if increasing the primary air from 3000 rpm to a higher value for a duty cycle greater than 50% leads to more severe and even charring. Additionally, bringing the primary air back towards the hopper at the same circumferential height could increase hot region residence time and devolatilize the biomass more before it reaches the chimney, potentially aiding in volumetric reduction of biomass.\n\nLastly, the experiment mentions that the NPT couplings (S9 and S8) were stuck and could not be opened, even with longer wrenches.", 'N/A', 'The primary blower speed for this experiment is not mentioned in the provided information.', "Based on the provided information, here are some observations and potential explanations:\n\n1. Bridging issue: Despite enlarging the hopper, the bridging issue still persists. The next step suggested is to lower the hopper temperature to 15 degrees and see if bridging improves. This indicates that the size of the hopper may not be the only factor contributing to the bridging issue, and temperature could also play a role.\n\n2. Auger jamming: Initially, no jamming was observed when feeding chunky wood chips in cold flow. However, severe jamming occurred after the reactor was lit for a while. This suggests that the jamming issue may be related to the temperature of the reactor. It is mentioned that the jamming resolved itself once the reactor got hot, indicating that the temperature increase helped alleviate the jamming. However, the exact cause of the jamming, such as the transition above the chimney or other factors, needs further investigation.\n\n3. Hopper smoke/fire: After the auger was stuck for a long period, it is suspected that the fire from the reactor region propagated downwards towards the hopper, causing the biomass at the hopper base to light on fire and/or start smoking. Lowering the primary/secondary air seemed to help with smoke mitigation, but the issue returned when the blower RPM was increased. This suggests that the airflow and temperature control in the reactor may need to be optimized to prevent the fire/smoke propagation towards the hopper.\n\n4. Output rate and yield: The input feed rate was approximately 41 kg/h, while the output rate was about 33 kg/h, implying a mass yield of 80%. However, it is mentioned that the output rate needs to be double-checked as it may not be accurate. Additionally, the scale logging shows a wavy feature, indicating a potential issue with the scale's proper functioning. This needs to be addressed to ensure accurate measurement of the output rate and yield.\n\n5. Char quality: The obtained char showed variations in charring levels, with some parts undercharred (brownish) at around 60-80% charred. This suggests that the combustion process may not be uniform throughout the reactor, leading to inconsistent char quality. Further investigation is needed to identify the factors contributing to this variation and optimize the process for consistent char production.\n\nOverall, these observations provide insights into the combustion process and machine design. Further experimentation and analysis are required to address the identified issues and optimize the biomass to biochar formation process in the reactor.", 'The primary blower position was set at S10. The primary air setpoint was initially set at 3000, and the secondary air was set at 4000. The feedstock used was rice hulls. The experiment observed that the hopper fire/smoke persisted, indicating the need to eliminate the variable pitch for rice husks. The char level below the chimney remained high throughout the experiment, despite attempts to address it by pausing the auger or inserting a rod into the reaction zone. Increasing the primary air only worsened the smoke from the hopper. The experiment ran for approximately 20-30 minutes with the oil drum full. The input feed rate was around 33 kg/h, and the char appeared to be around 90-100% charred.', 'The primary blower position in this hot test was S6.', 'The primary blower speed for this hot test is not mentioned in the provided information.', 'Based on the observations and suggestions provided, here are some possible explanations and recommendations:\n\nObservations:\n1. Black smoke in the chimney and periodic appearance of smoke in the hopper.\n2. Flow of chips that end up not being charred (mixing problem).\n3. Incomplete char formation and no steady state achieved.\n4. Biochar recorded was partially charred/under charred.\n\nPossible Explanations:\n1. The reduced lighting time and primary blower speed may have caused incomplete combustion, leading to the formation of black smoke.\n2. The mixing problem could be due to inadequate mixing of the biomass in the reactor, resulting in some chips not being fully charred.\n3. The changes in settings may have disrupted the combustion process, preventing the attainment of a steady state.\n4. The partial char formation could be a result of incomplete combustion or suboptimal operating conditions.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Analyze possible scenarios and conduct further experiments to understand the reasons behind the smoke in the chimney and hopper. Adjust the lighting time and primary blower speed to find a balance between avoiding smoke and achieving complete combustion.\n2. Improve the mixing mechanism to ensure better contact between the biomass and oxygen. This could involve modifying the auger design or introducing additional mixing elements.\n3. Investigate the impact of the prototype angle on the combustion process. Adjust the angle if necessary to optimize the char formation.\n4. Increase the secondary blower speed to enhance secondary combustion and improve overall combustion efficiency.\n5. Monitor and control the temperature more effectively to achieve a steady state and optimize the char formation.\n6. Consider conducting additional tests with different feedstocks to evaluate their impact on the combustion process and char quality.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations and conducting further experiments, you can gain a better understanding of the combustion process and machine design, and potentially improve the efficiency and quality of biochar production in the reactor.', 'Based on the provided information, it seems that the experiment is focused on biomass combustion (pyrolysis) in the presence of oxygen to produce biochar. The experiment involves a small-sized reactor with a hopper for biomass input, an auger for biomass transportation, and thermocouples to measure temperature at different locations. Primary blowers supply air (oxygen) to the reactor zone, while secondary blowers remove volatiles through a chimney.\n\nThe objective of the experiment is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the combustion process and machine design by testing different hypotheses. In the example hot test mentioned, the hypothesis was to increase secondary air to address black smoke issues and adjust the position of one blower to address white smoke issues from the hopper.\n\nThe experiment settings included the primary blower positioned at S5 on the right side, while the left side primary blower remained at S10 due to a stuck viewing port NPT plug. The primary air setpoint was initially 3000 rpm during start-up, then reduced to 2500 and 2200 rpm. The secondary air remained at 4000 rpm throughout. A mega chimney without any mesh at the top was used, and a newly refurbished six-inch pitch auger was employed in a 35-degree setup.\n\nThe feedstock used in this particular test was pine tree wood chips from Anahim Lake, Canada. The reactor ran at a high temperature throughout the experiment. White ash was observed, although it was not easily visible against a white wall but was noticeable against the blue sky. Puffs of black smoke occasionally emerged from the chimney, leading to a gradual reduction in primary air. However, it was later discovered that the primary and secondary blower wires on the right side were switched, resulting in an inconclusive outcome. White smoke was still observed near the hopper cracks and through the hopper, and it was suspected that frequent poking into the hopper to avoid voidage may have contributed to the smoke.\n\nDetailed observations included the presence of wetter parts inside the wood chip pile. Flow rates were calculated based on cumulative output and input mass, indicating a mass yield of approximately 28%. However, when considering output mass flow and input mass, the mass yield was estimated to be around 12%. The output mass scale exhibited unusual undulating behavior, raising doubts about the reliability of the readout for output mass flow.\n\nUnfortunately, the example answer provided does not specify the specific information or question for which an answer is expected.', 'The primary blower speed for the hot test was initially set at 5 (S5) and later changed to 2500 rpm.', 'The average interval for running the auger without getting smoke and issues is 10.5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 2.12 minutes. The average interval for stopping the auger for an interval of 3 minutes is 2.82 minutes.\n\nTo plot these intervals, you can create a bar chart or a histogram. The x-axis can represent the intervals, and the y-axis can represent the frequency or count of each interval. This will give you a visual representation of the distribution of start/stop intervals.\n\nFor the next steps, the hypothesis could be tested by stopping hopper-poking and observing the difference in hopper white smoke. The statistics of auger on and auger off time intervals can be used to measure the difference.', 'Primary blower speed: S10 (farther from electric box), S5 (closest to electric box)\nSecondary blower speed: Idle initially (1300 rpm), then 3000 rpm (primary) and 4000 rpm (secondary)\nFeedstock: Douglas Fir wood chips from Williams Lake, Canada\n\nSummary:\n- The hot test encountered several inconveniences, including a loose bolt, dismantled power supply, and unreliable connection between the PLC and computer.\n- The reaction descended into the hopper, leading to the shutdown of the hot test.\n- The biochar collection system using the new chute worked smoothly.\n- The fire took too long to light, causing the reaction to go back to the auger.\n- Steady-state temperature was not achieved despite reaching high temperatures.\n- The biochar output was lower than expected, totaling around 20.22 kg.\n- The new chute did not catch fire, confirming its adequacy.\n- The chips used were dry, dusty, and fluffy, resulting in faster and hotter burning.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Consider the differences in conditions and chips used compared to the setup in Anahim Lake for obtaining a steady-state hot test.\n- Aim to be quicker when lighting the fire in the next hot test.\n- Implement an interval system based on previous analysis.', 'The primary blower speed for this hot test was not mentioned in the provided information.', "Based on the observations and results from the hot test, it is suggested to run the demo with the following settings: \n\n- Primary blower speed: 2,200 rpm\n- Secondary blower speed: 3,000 rpm\n- Aluminum tape covering any possible airholes in the hopper\n\nThese settings seemed to provide a smooth operation with minor smoke. The resulting biochar at these settings was of reasonable consistency. However, when the primary blower speed was reduced to 1,700 rpm, backflow occurred and greater smoke came out of the hopper. The resulting biochar at this lower speed was less consistent, comprising both black char and medium brownish/torefied char.\n\nThe aim for the demo is to find a balance between minimizing smoke in the hopper and obtaining fully charred results. Therefore, it is recommended to use the settings mentioned above for the demo on October 10-11, 2022, as they seem most appropriate for the Douglas Fir wood chips from William's Lake to run smoothly through the reactor.", 'The primary blower speed for the hot test #105 was set at S5, which corresponds to a speed of 5.', 'Based on the provided information, it seems that the experiment is focused on biomass combustion (pyrolysis) in the presence of oxygen to produce biochar.

The experiment utilized a newly refurbished six-inch pitch auger and a prototype at a 35-degree angle setup.\n\nThe feedstock used for this test was Douglas Fir wood chips from Williams Lake, Canada. The experiment summary indicates that the test performed well initially, but after 1-2 hours, hopper smoke started to appear. Attempts were made to mitigate the smoke by poking the biomass vigorously or temporarily idling the air or stopping the auger. However, these measures did not have a significant effect. Moving the left-side primary blower from S5 to S10 also did not provide substantial improvement.

The feedstock used was woodchips from Cloverdale.\n\nDuring the hot test, there were some issues with the procedure. Lighting the chips from S9 may have influenced the amount of smoke in the hopper. The open ports caused negative pressure, and running the primary blowers at a higher speed generated positive pressure through the open ports. The experiment ended when the hopper caught fire. The input feed rate was around 24.654 kg/h, and the output feed rate fluctuated between 1 and 2.
